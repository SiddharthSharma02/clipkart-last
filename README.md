# ClipKart - YouTube Shorts Creator

ClipKart is a Python web application that automatically downloads YouTube videos and creates vertical short-form videos (1080x1920) with captions from the first 45 seconds. The output videos are optimized for platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts.

## ✨ Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Dark-themed web interface with progress tracking
- **Customizable Settings**: Control output format and caption options
- **Local Storage**: Save videos directly to your computer
